ExpandTabsOnLoad
================

A Sublime Text plugin to automatically convert tabs to spaces when a file is loaded. 

I prefer replacing on load rather than on save, because it allows visual checking of the file before committing to the tab replacement, as opposed to invisibly performing the replacement on save (like  most of the similar plugins I've encountered).

## Installation

To install, just clone this repository into your Sublime Text user packages folder.
